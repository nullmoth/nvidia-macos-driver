# 1401 and NVIDIA driver 1.11.0

## Mac app
- "AMFIPass.kext is not in this OpenCore EFI" no longer stops an install or update. Setup downloads Lilu and AMFIPass itself, from the same files 1401 builds with, checks each SHA-256 before changing anything, copies them into the EFI and adds them to the config.
- Firefox (and other apps that crashed at launch with AMFI relaxed) open: setup adds the `ipc_control_port_options=0` boot argument.
- A driver installed from the release `.tar.gz` records its version, so the app stops offering the version you already have.
- "STOP back up nvmtl" is fixed: the backup copies the Vulkan library links correctly.
- Installing a USB map no longer stops when USBToolBox is missing; setup adds it.
- When setup cannot tell which OpenCore partition started the Mac, it says why (OpenCore hides its boot path) and what to change (Misc > Security > ExposeSensitiveData 7), or you can choose the partition in the app. When it finds no OpenCore at all, it lists every partition it sees so the next report shows the cause.
- **Send logs** now includes the kernel log of the boots before this one, so a boot that hung or went black (which writes no panic) can be read, and panics macOS moved to its Retired folder.

## Windows (1401 1.11.0)
- Builds for a supported NVIDIA card include Lilu and AMFIPass, so the Mac app never has to ask for them.
- PCs stuck at the prohibited sign / `EB.MM.AKM`: a build after **Send logs** now reads the stick's last startup log too (it was moved into `NullMoth\sent-logs` and the build missed it), and sending that log tells you to build again. Starting an old stick again changes nothing; build it again with 1.11.
- Laptops with an Intel Iris Xe that macOS cannot drive no longer fail the build.
- A stick whose OpenCore EFI was not built by 1401 is named as the problem when its logs are sent.
- A failed stick write shows the real error instead of an internal one.

## Still open
- Screen flicker or a black screen above 60 Hz on some DisplayPort monitors. Use **Record the flicker** while it happens, then **Send logs**.
- WebGL in browsers, and some Apple Arcade games.
- HDMI and DisplayPort audio from the NVIDIA card.
- Laptops whose built-in screen is wired to the Intel graphics (no MUX switch).

## Scope
macOS 15 Sequoia. Requires OpenCore.
