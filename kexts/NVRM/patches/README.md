# NVIDIA 610 display completion archive

The framebuffer and accelerator allocation interface changes must be built and installed together. Use the NVRMFB framebuffer source and the matching NVRM headers from this revision.

`610-display-completion.patch` implements the mapped flip notifier query and resets the selected slot for each committed surface. NVIDIA modeset treats the BEGUN notifier state as the latched flip; FINISHED is also accepted. Invalid or unavailable notifier state keeps the transaction pending.

With the original NVIDIA 610.57.04 Darwin modeset archive and compile commands already built, run:

```
python3 kexts/NVRM/build-completion-archive.py --vendor /build/vendor/src/nvidia-modeset --output /build/paired-completion
```

Link NVRM against the resulting `libnvkms.a`, not the original archive. The script preserves the original archive and replaces only the completion object and release build metadata. Build NVAccel with the matching allocation cookie interface. The release qualification covers macOS 15; macOS 26 requires separate accelerator and runtime qualification.

## RM boot-failure cleanup

`610-fsp-timer-double-destroy.patch` applies to the open-gpu-kernel-modules 610.57.04 tree (`git apply` from its root) before the RM objects are built. When the FSP boot commands fail, `kfspCleanupBootState` runs from both the failure path and `kfspStateDestroy`; the second `tmrEventDestroy` faulted on the freed OS timer (page fault at 0x1010 in `nv_destroy_nano_timer`). The patch destroys the poll event once and clears the OS timer handle after cancelling it.
